## About

Thanks for dropping by. I actually started this site to report progress on a university course for Git,
we´re on week called semana I, a new initiative of ITESM. I´m a software enginneer currently on my last
year of the bachelor, I´m also working as a Dev 2 in Oracle MDC in a project called Genetic Bug, mostly
doing the web appliance system for it, we use Ruby and Rails for the backend and Ember.js for the
frontend.

But, apart from being a <strike>cool guy</strike> geek, I enjoy playing basketball, hang out with my
friends, I loooveee to eat and it is way better if acommpanied by my girlfriend.
